# Using UprootJob in LCG94python3
On any machine that has access to `/cvmfs`, the following setup script will install the relevant packages as user.
```bash
source setup_lcg.sh
```
On future use, run `source env_lcg.sh`, and start a notebook server with, e.g. `jupyter notebook --no-browser --port $PORT`, substituing your favorite port: pick a random integer in (8000,65535).
Often, you'll need an ssh tunnel, which can be accomplished via, e.g. `ssh -L $PORT:localhost:$PORT server.address`

# Using a docker container
The docker container can run both uproot and striped jobs (although xrootd has not been tested yet.)
You probably want to run it on your laptop.  For striped jobs, you will also need to VPN to the fermilab network.
To run, execute
```bash
./run_container.sh
```
then go to http://localhost:8888/ and insert the token
